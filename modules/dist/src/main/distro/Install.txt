Installation instructions
=========================

In order to install JBossWS the following steps are necessary:

1.) Copy ant.properties.examples to ant.properties
2.) Modify the target container location in ant.properties
3.) Execute one of the following

	ant deploy-jboss720
	ant deploy-wildfly800
	ant deploy-wildfly810
	ant deploy-wildfly900

    By default Spring Framework libraries are not installed to application
server. In order to do that, please add the -Dspring=true property option when
running the ant script:

        ant -Dspring=true deploy-jboss800

Please note Spring is required for advanced configuration only, whenever users
want to provide their own jbossws-cxf.xml Spring configuration file.

4.) Execute the samples to verify your installation

   'ant tests'

   You should see no errors.
