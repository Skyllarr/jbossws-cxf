Release Notes
=============

The project home page (http://www.jboss.org/jbossws) and the community wiki
(http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossWS) are usually good starting points.
They contain the User Guide and Quick Start instructions.

A list of examples that accompany the UserGuide can be found in the tests directory
that ship with the distribution.
